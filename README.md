# Animal Depot Management System
- The Animal Depot Management System (ADMS) is a graphic user interface that allows the manager and the employees to carry out maintenance and management of database and basically it is the Menagerie / Zoological Park data management system.
- The three groups of users for this application are the managers, the animal keepers and the animal trainers. 
- ADMS uses RDBMS for storage and retrieval of data. There will only be one super user(Manager) who has all rights. Super user has the access to add/update the database and employee can only view the content as required. For creating database we have used Oracleâ€™s 11g XE which is standard and easy to work with. 
- This database consists consists of 16 tables and all are included in association with one or more tables.
